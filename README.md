# Brackets-MIPS-Syntax-Highlighter
This is still a work in progress. Hopefully to be done fairly quickly. Apparently I have to make a new CodeMirror mode, etc.

Feel free to jump on board and help get this little extention complete!

#[Download Installer for v0.0.1 Now! :D](https://github.com/naphipps/brackets-mips-syntax-highlighter/blob/master/Installer/MIPS%20Syntax%20Highlighter%20for%20Brackets%20v0.0.1.dmg?raw=true)
#####(In case it prompts about replacing the current files: Yes. Always replace them.)

Please let me know if you have any issues, suggestions, or anything of the nature [here] (https://github.com/naphipps/brackets-mips-syntax-highlighter/issues). Thank you! :D

##Curious about my future goals?!
####These things below are coming soon!
- making user-defined variables highlight the same color from .data to .text (and visa-versa)
- making labels highlight differently than user-defined variables
- Add error checking
 
(Mainly, my goal is to make the highlighter make sense visually. I haven't been satisfied with any mips assembly highlighter. Thus, I'm making my own.)

#IGNORE EVERYTHING BELOW
##That is for when I finish the syntax highlighter

============================

[Brackets](http://brackets.io) is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS and JavaScript that's built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That is, a modern code editor for web designers and front-end developers.

This is a Brackets extension adding syntax highlighting for MIPS Assembly files (.s and .sx files).

##How to install this extension
The extension can be directly installed using the Extension Manager of Brackets.

1. File -> Extension Manager 
2. Search for MIPS
3. Click install on MIPS Assembly Syntax Highlighter extension

And that's all. Now you can enjoy syntax highlighting for MIPS Assembly files in Brackets

If MIPS is not set automatically as default language for .s and .sx files, click on the current language at bottom right of Brackets window and select MIPS in the dropdown menu.

This extension is (NOT yet) registered @ [Brackets Extension Registry](https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com).
