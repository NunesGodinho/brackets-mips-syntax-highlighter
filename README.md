# Brackets-MIPS-Syntax-Highlighter
This is still a work in progress. Hopefully to be done fairly quickly. Apparently I have to make a new CodeMirror mode, etc.

Feel free to jump on board and help get this little extention complete!

Right now, I've just been testing around with other syntax highlighters for other languages.

I can't seem to get this mode thing working quite right.

Also having trouble testing it inside brackets... I just don't know if I'm doing anything right...
