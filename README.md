##Curious about my future goals?!
####These things below are coming in the distant future if I find time to get to it for fun.
- making user-defined variables highlight the same color from .data to .text (and visa-versa)
- making labels highlight differently than user-defined variables
- Add error checking
 
(Mainly, my goal is to make the highlighter make sense visually. I haven't been satisfied with any mips assembly highlighter. Thus, I'm making my own.)
